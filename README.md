<h1> E-Voting System Using Blockchain & Homomorphic Encryption</h1>
<h5>Only about half of the elections are deemed to be free and fair, according to a study. 
Electoral fraud not only distorts the quality of representation, but also has an impact on 
political, social, and economic results. Homomorphic encryption and blockchain 
technologies can be utilized to secure free and fair elections. 
In this paper, we aim to allow only the eligible citizens to vote by automatically checking 
their eligibility status from a federally approved application and then securing the 
voter’s data using homomorphic encryption rather than encrypting the vote cast by the 
voter. By doing this, statistical analysis can be performed on the data which results in a 
unique set of insights that may otherwise remain unknown.</h5>
